# m-permissions
This is the m-permissions example repository for DroidCon 2015 / GDG Meetup Hamburg

Please keep in mind that this code is just an example to show how the new Permissions System in Android Marshmallow works.

This Sample app has 2 main functionalities that demonstrates how the permissions for Contacts and Location can be handled.

In case a permission is denied for the first time, a nice screen explaining the user why this certain permission is needed, is shown to the user.
