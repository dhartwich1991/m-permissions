# m-permissions
This is the m-permissions example repository for DroidCon 2015 / GDG Meetup Hamburg

Please keep in mind that this code is just an example to show how the new Permissions System in Android Marshmallow works.

This Sample app has 2 main functionalities that demonstrates how the permissions for Contacts and Location can be handled.

In case a permission is denied for the first time, a nice screen explaining the user why this certain permission is needed, is shown to the user.

If you want to get an impression on how the app looks feel free to see the screenshots below:
